I want to experiment on some things. 

Problem statements: 

A simple backend application using express js. I want to achieve and experiment on the steps given below:

1. Using post method, uploading a voice data and get a response with its transcription. (Initially just transcribe, but future scope will be to do it real time using socket.io)

2. Make translation in any Language of the transcribed data. (Future scope will be the same as step 1, user will have the option to select specific language) 

3. An AI response to that voice data, in text. 

4. AI response in voice (text to speech) for the that text data( future scope will be to make realtime  with less latency)
